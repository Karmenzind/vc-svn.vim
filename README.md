# vc-svn

This plugin is forked from vc.vim which is the best (or the only usable) Vim plugin for SVN but obviously no longer being maintained so I have to do it myself. 
I only use the SVN part because there are tons of better choices for Git.
For now most updates are about `:VCBlame` because all I need is blaming people.
This repo will be archived as soon as I switch my job because I hate SVN.

## Updates

    - [x] Faster
    - [x] More compact content

##Recomended settings at .vimrc

let g:vc_browse_cache_all = 1
    This enables caching, Listing of files will be faster, On MAC/Unix the default location is $HOME/.cache.
    A new directory vc will be created in the specified directory.

    For windows this option must be specified along with the cache dir
    let g:vc_cache_dir="C:/Users/user1"

let g:vc_branch_url = ["svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches/", "svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/tags/"]
    This settings when available will provide menu's to navigate available branches and tags for VCLog

let g:vc_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk";
    This settings when available will provide menu's to navigate trunk files for VCLog
